        <h4><li><u>Smart and Connected Communities: Technological Foundations, Challenges and Opportunities (SCC-2018)</u></li></h4>
        <p style="color:#000099"><i><strong>Date: January 07, 2017</strong></i></p>
        <p>Smart and connected communities envision an integrated society where people, resources, services and cultures will work together for better future in an integrated way. The primary catalyst that has enabled this concept has been the massive integration of internet of things into the daily fabric of the community. This integration combined with effective big data analytics has enabled progress in multiple domains including transportation, emergency response, air quality monitoring, and energy sustainability, to name a few application domains. Additionally, various organizations, government agencies and city planners are continuously coming up with ambitious goals and projects to create Smart Cities that utilize the emerging technologies. However, most of these solutions are one of a kind and are not easily replicated and shared among cities. In this workshop, we will delve into details of the challenges of technical interoperable infrastructure based on the analysis of open data platform. The goal of this workshop is to serve as a platform to bring together leading researchers and eminent scientists from academic institutions, R&D organizations, national and government labs and practicing professionals from India and abroad for exchange of ideas and to discuss state-of-the-art approaches related to interoperability, data analytics and smart and connected community applications.

        <h4><li><u>Computing and Networking for Internet of Things and Beyond</u></li></h4>
        <p style="color:#000099"><i><strong>Date: January 04, 2017</strong></i></p>
        <p>Over the past few years, Internet of Things (IoT) has been considered as an innovative and imminent information infrastructure enabling various machines, physical devices, and objects, denoted as things, to interact ubiquitously for environment sensing, information sharing and collaboration in intelligent and autonomous manner. The concept has now further been extended to Industry 4.0, and Tactile Internet which are acting as catalysts to the evolution of a new generation of services expected to have immense impact on the social and technological eco-system. It can be envisaged that these next generation systems and services will encompass several domains such as e-Governance, Manufacturing, Retail, Health Care, Transportation, Waste Management, Food Supply Chains, Energy & Utilities, Insurance, etc. New technologies and applications built on top of them must be developed in order to fulfil this vision of Intelligent Infrastructure and Industry 4.0. The evolving Internet concept poses a number of new challenges and opportunities for computing, networking, data management and analytics due to the large scale and complexity of such systems, and heterogeneity of the things and networks, constrained by limited resources of the things and the network and the requirement of extreme low latency in both computation and communication. The goal of ComNet-IoT 2016 is to provide an inter-disciplinary platform for researchers to exchange ideas, present results, share experience, stimulate new research, and foster collaborations among researchers, professionals, and application developers on the various aspects of computing, networking, information and distributed systems technologies for the evolving Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and Tactile Internet, including back-end infrastructure such as the Cloud and Fog/Edge networks.

        <h4><li><u>Networking Women in Distributed Computing and Networks (NWDCN)</u></li></h4>
        <p style="color:#000099"><i><strong>Date: January 04, 2017</strong></i></p>
        <p>Recent progress in the areas of distributed computing, wired and wireless networks and mobile computing encouraged many women engineers to work in these fields. Over the past decade, wireless communication and mobile computing have become the most influential technologies in the evolution of new form of distributed computing. Additionally, advances in cloud computing has changed the world of computing by eliminating the requirement of owning large-scale servers by the organizations and shifting the computing tasks towards the data centers. The combination of new forms of networks and distributed computing have given rise of emerging areas like Internet of Things, Big Data management and analytics etc. Originated from RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), the paradigm of IoT has been transforming every aspect of human life including healthcare, energy, transportation, and manufacturing. This workshop will consider the research works which have escalated this change in the computing world. The workshop will also highlight the applications which have been built on top of the modern distributed computing systems with particular focus on healthcare, transportation and smart city. The workshop will focus on networking the women researchers working in the emerging fields of some of these research areas.

        <h4><li><u>Real-Time Stream Analytics and Machine Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems (RTSML4CPS)</u></li></h4>
        <p style="color:#000099"><i><strong>Date: January 04, 2017</strong></i></p>
        <p>Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are built around various services and applications which are deployed on the top of sensors and actuators, communication topologies and variety of computing platforms. Connection among these components creates multiple end-to-end task chains which need to work under resource constrained environments. CPSs have ability to adapt and to learn. CPSs continuously analyze their environment. They learn patterns and correlations among various instances/events based on their observations about the environment. Identifying these correlations and patterns, they tend to build significant predictive models. Applications of CPSs are in multiple domains ranging from condition monitoring and maintenance to image processing and diagnosis. In CPSs, the tight coupling between physical and computation processes has resulted in production of large volumes of data. This accumulated data is analyzed and interpreted for prediction, planning and decision-making process. Machine Learning (ML) is the key technology for these developments. ML algorithms can significantly put the base for our decisions in all parts of our daily lives. ML techniques can significantly collaborate with CPSs to carry out monitoring and control to minimize the latency between control message reception and decision making. However, all these processing is limited by low resourced devices. The proposed workshop will help in capturing inherent challenges and opportunities associated with real-time stream analytics and machine learning with respect to CPS. Focus of the workshop is in exploring the state of art technologies involved in real time analytics of infinite scale streaming data in context of CPSs. Multi-dimensional aspects of distributed real-time analytics and learning for wide range of applications such as healthcare, transportation, energy sector, and other domains will be evaluated in order to extract pros and cons along with futuristic advancements that is in progress or may be incorporated to enable large scale real-time and adaptive stream analytics and learning in CPSs.
