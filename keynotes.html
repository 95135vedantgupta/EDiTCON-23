              <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nanoscale electronics, pervasive connectivity, and cloud computing have together ushered in the Internet of Things (IoT). The first generation of IoT has led to myriads of
                sensors in embedded, wearable, and mobile platforms collecting data to sense the state of various natural, engineered, and human systems with sensory information flowing through distributed multi-tiered networks and distributed
                computing architectures. A salient feature of IoT has been that connectivity between embedded devices and cloud services has revolutionized sensing systems. The ease with which sensor measurements and commands can flow between the
                sensors and the cloud allow sophisticated algorithms, massive computing resources, and large-scale data to be brought to bear on the task of sensemaking in multiple domains such as health, energy management, transportation, etc.
                However, the first generation of sensing-focused IoT systems are precursors of a new generation of IoT systems where the sensor data will be used to influence and control the state of human-cyber-physical systems at multiple scales
                ranging from personal to societal. The sensor data, instead of being ingested primarily for slower time-scale knowledge discovery and decision making, is becoming part of a complex web of distributed autonomous and semi-autonomous
                feedback loops controlling and coordinating swarms of autonomous devices owned and managed by multiple parties and intelligently operating in shared spaces while interacting with humans and the physical world around them. This
                emerging paradigm of pervasive perception, cognition, and action presents a broad spectrum of unprecedented challenges: extreme scale, unstable dynamics, variability and heterogeneity, time and location awareness, ultra-low latency
                requirements, intermittent resource availability, fragility to attacks and privacy risks. Our current information technology infrastructure – comprising the three distinct and largely independently developed technologies behind the
                Internet, datacenters, and embedded edge devices – can only suboptimally cope with these challenges. Addressing them requires a distributed computing substrate that takes an integrated view of the key functions - sensing, processing,
                learning, memory, dissemination, actuation - while optimizing across layers of processing and networking to achieve performance, security, and other guarantees.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify">In this talk I would seek to highlight various challenges and opportunities in the path towards developing an architecture for a networked and distributed computing substrate upon which future applications
                with perception-cognition-action loops at extreme and diverse spatiotemporal scales can be hosted with performance, security, robustness, and privacy guarantees. In particular, the talk will described recent work towards (i) A
                distributed system architecture which supports the new notion of Quality of Time which makes uncertainty in time observable and controllable in order to robustly support time-aware applications across the edge-middle-cloud tiers, (ii)
                Learning-enabled edge devices with efficient rich inferencing and data-driven modeling for enhancing performance, human-awareness, and security. The ideas described in this talk have been developed and refined with the help of many
                close research collaborators through a series of collaborative research projects and proposals. The author would in particular like to thank Anthony Rowe, Paulo Tabuada, Rajesh Gupta, Saman Zonouz, Santosh Kumar, Supriyo Chakraborty,
                and Tarek Abdelzaher. Moreover, the generous support of funding agencies that have supported author’s research in recent years- Army Research Laboratory, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, IARPA, and DARPA -
                is graciously acknowledged.

                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract: </strong>About 10 years ago, in 2008, the enigma "Satoshi Nakamoto" published a white paper on a crypto mailing list describing the Bitcoin digital currency. Three months later,
                  Nakamoto released Version 0.1 of the Bitcoin software. Nakamoto's "blockchain" (a term not in found in the original paper) is arguably one of the biggest success stories in distributed computing: One can hardly open a newspaper
                  without some article claiming that the blockchain will revolutionize the world. The blockchain is a fault-tolerant distributed system that is simple and scalable. On the other hand, there are various consensus and agreement
                  protocols designed by the real distributed systems community, e.g. Lamport's Paxos. These protocols usually provide strong consistency, but have scalability issues. What can we learn from Nakamoto, what could Nakamoto learn from us?
                  And is the blockchain really the future?

                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract: </strong>This talk will be focussing on issues related to local computation in networks, i.e., the ability to solve tasks by having each node merely inspecting the inputs of nearby
                  nodes. Specifically, the talk will survey a couple of recent results regarding solving LCL tasks, that is, tasks whose solutions can be locally verified. Two aspect of local computation will be addressed. One is about the ability to
                  derandomize randomized algorithms solving tasks in a constant number of rounds. The other is about solving a large collection of locally checkable tasks in a number of rounds sub-linear in the maximum degree of the network.
